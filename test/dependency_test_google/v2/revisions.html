The V8 benchmark suite is changed from time to time as we fix bugs or
expand the scope of the benchmarks.  Here is a list of revisions, with
a description of the changes made.  Note that benchmark results are
not comparable unless both results are run with the same revision of
the benchmark suite.

<div class="subtitle"><h3>Version 2 (<a href="http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/data/benchmarks/v2/run.html">link</a>)</h3></div>

<p>For version 2 the crypto benchmark was fixed.  Previously, the
decryption stage was given plaintext as input, which resulted in an
error.  Now, the decryption stage is given the output of the
encryption stage as input.  The result is checked against the original
plaintext.  For this to give the correct results the crypto objects
are reset for each iteration of the benchmark.  In addition, the size
of the plain text has been increased a little and the use of
Math.random() and new Date() to build an RNG pool has been
removed. </p>

<p>Other benchmarks were fixed to do elementary verification of the
results of their calculations.  This is to avoid accidentally
obtaining scores that are the result of an incorrect JavaScript engine
optimization.</p>
